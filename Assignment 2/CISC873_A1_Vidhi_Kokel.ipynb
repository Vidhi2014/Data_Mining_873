        "#### 🌈 Why Data Mining is a misnomer? What is another preferred name?\n",
        "#### Data Mining actually refers to extraction of knowledge or patterns from large amounts of data and not extracting (or mining) the data itself. Hence, it is a misnomer. Other preferred names of Data Mining are:\n",
        "1. Knowledge discovery (mining) in databases (KDD)\n",
        "2. Knowledge extraction\n",
        "3. Data/pattern analysis\n",
        "4. Data archaeology\n",
        "5. Data dredging\n",
        "6. Information harvesting\n",

        "#### 🌈 What is the general knowledge discovery process? \n",
        "#### The knowledge discovery process (KDP), also called knowledge discovery in databases, seeks new knowledge in some application domain. It is defined as the nontrivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data.\n",
        "##### Source: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-36795-8_2\n",

        "#### 🌈 What is the difference between a data engineer and data scientist/AI engineer?\n",
        "1. The primary role of a data engineer is to design and develop a highly maintainable database management system. The primary role of a data scientist is to take the raw data from the database and use it to provide insights to improve the business.\n",
        "2. A data engineer works mainly on the design and architecture of a database management system. In contrast, a data scientist works on applying analytical tools and modeling techniques to process the data.\n",
        "3. A data engineer is responsible for transforming Big Data into a useful form for analysis. The data scientist does the actual analysis of this Big Data.\n",
        "4. Data engineers serve as the wardens for the storage and movement of data. They design, build, test, and maintain databases to extract, load, and update data on database management systems. Data scientists take this data using various queries specified by the data engineer for data retrieval. They apply machine learning or deep learning models to the data to identify patterns and glean valuable insights from the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 🌈 In data mining, what is the difference between prediction and categorization?\n",
        "#### Categorization/Classification is the process of identifying to which category, a new observation belongs to on the basis of a training data set containing observations whose category membership is known. Prediction is the process of identifying the missing or unavailable numerical data for a new observation.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 🌈 Why data science/machine learning is a bad idea in the context of information security?\n",
        "#### Because there are multiple security risks listed as follows while implementing the data science/machine learning practices.\n",
        "1. Adversarial samples - Modifying the dataset slightly without any visible change thus leading to unexpected outcomes\n",
        "2. Backdoor Attack - Introduction of corrupt or bad samples in the training dataset can contribute in highly misleading the model.\n",
        "3. Information Leak - Model is solely evaluated based on testing\n",
        "performance metric before release/deployment, but it could store or might have more information that could be exposed to the attackers.\n",
        "4. Ethical Issues - Systems designers choose the features, metrics, and analytics structures of the models that enable data mining. Thus, data-driven\n",
        "technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, can potentially replicate the\n",
        "preconceptions and biases of their designer.\n",
        "5. Increased risk of data breach and fine\n",
        "6. Increased uncertainty\n",
        "7. Difficult to evaluate change in models\n",
        "8. Difficult to verify against compliance\n",

        "#### 🌈 What is CIA principle and how can we use it to access the security/privacy aspect of the AI system/pipelines?\n",
        "#### The CIA principle means, the data should be Confidential, should have some Integrity and should be Available.\n",
        "#### To fight against confidentiality breaches, you can classify and label restricted data, enable access control policies, encrypt data, and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems. It is also advisable to ensure that all in the organization have the training and knowledge they need to recognize the dangers and avoid them.\n",
        "#### To protect the integrity of your data, you can use hashing, encryption, digital certificates, or digital signatures. For websites, you can employ trustworthy certificate authorities (CAs) that verify the authenticity of your website so visitors know they are getting the site they intended to visit. \n",
